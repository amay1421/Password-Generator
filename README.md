# Password-Generator

![alt text](http://url/to/unit3.png)

This is a password generator that will give users a random password based on the criteria they select. The user will choose the length of their password from 8-138 characters. They will then decide if they would like the password to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers or special characters. After they have finished answering all of those fields a password will be generated in the text box.
